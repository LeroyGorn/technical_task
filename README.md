Hello there ! To use my code, you should:
1) Firstly install packages from requirements.txt
2) Then specify postgres database settings in your own .env file or manually in files.
3) After simply load main.py file or build and run docker image.
4) Wait until script finished it work and then you can see all data in your postgres DB :)

Tech stack:
requests, sqlalchemy, postgresDB, docker.
Dump file - dump.sql
Main working file - main.py
